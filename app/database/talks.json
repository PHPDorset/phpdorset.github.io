For most applications this works well, but as apps grow or experience increased traffic, each task adds extra milliseconds to a request, leaving users waiting.\n\nA common solution is to defer these tasks to the background using a cron task. However, there is a better way. Job queues not only help to decouple your application and improve resilience but will also cut request times.\n\nIn this talk I we’ll explore some common queue systems; the features and tradeoffs of each solution, what to queue, refactoring existing code into jobs, and running workers. By the end you’ll be ready to build your next app one job at a time.",

Docker allows you, a developer, to specify the exact environment your application needs to run, across development; test; staging; and production. In this talk I will cover the creation of this utopian distributable and show you how to can compose your entire production infrastructure locally with only a small YAML file and without installing a single thing.

But what happens if a developer has to be the one conducting the interview? Here we will switch things around, as we will go through the way the interviews should be conducted from the interviewer side. We will see what questions to ask, and how to gauge the answers from the candidate. We will look into how to structure the interview, and what techniques to use. Finally we will go over some of the interview basics and how to navigate the usual pitfalls of the job marketplace.

But beneath the cosy world of PHP, your network layer has been undergoing major changes that might be outside your comfort zone. IPv6, SPDY (aka HTTP/2.0) and SSL are all important technologies that you need to get to grips with, both inside and outside PHP. This talk covers the key features of these technologies and how you can use them to improve your app's availability, performance and security",

Of course, that's only half of the battle - once you have a machine you need to configure it. That's where Ansible comes in.</p><p>Ansible is a powerful server automation tool (think Puppet or Chef, but with a much lower learning curve), allowing you to install software and configure things as you need in a reproducible way.</p><p>By the end of this talk, everyone will be able to go home and create a Vagrant box that installs PHP, Apache2 and configures an example website with a custom VirtualHost in under 30 minutes.</p>",
