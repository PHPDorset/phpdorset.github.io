The reasons for this are far reaching but at a high level center around speed, flexibility and developer productivity. But what does this mean to a PHP developer?\n\nThis talk aims to answer that question. It provides an introduction to the Go programming language, how it differs from PHP, why you should consider using it and (perhaps most importantly) when you should use it. The talk will also cover some tricky areas that can trip you up as a new Go developer.\n\nThis won't be a lecture on why you should always use Go because it's \"just better\". Go is a great language and can be complimentary to nearly any developers skill set.",

That experience, and that search, led him to JSON Schema. In this talk, Stuart will introduce you to JSON Schema. He'll show you the essential points of writing a schema, and how to use it both from PHP and from JavaScript. Finally, he'll discuss the current state of the JSON schema draft, and share the compatibility issues he's seen over the last couple of years.",

For most applications this works well, but as apps grow or experience increased traffic, each task adds extra milliseconds to a request, leaving users waiting.\n\nA common solution is to defer these tasks to the background using a cron task. However, there is a better way. Job queues not only help to decouple your application and improve resilience but will also cut request times.\n\nIn this talk I we’ll explore some common queue systems; the features and tradeoffs of each solution, what to queue, refactoring existing code into jobs, and running workers. By the end you’ll be ready to build your next app one job at a time.",

Docker allows you, a developer, to specify the exact environment your application needs to run, across development; test; staging; and production. In this talk I will cover the creation of this utopian distributable and show you how to can compose your entire production infrastructure locally with only a small YAML file and without installing a single thing.

Here we will switch things around, as we will go through the way the interviews should be conducted from the interviewer side. We will see what questions to ask, and how to gauge the answers from the candidate. We will look into how to structure the interview, and what techniques to use. Finally we will go over some of the interview basics and how to navigate the usual pitfalls of the job marketplace.

Whether you're a front-end dev or back-end dev, Timber is sure to make you love WordPress again.\n\nJon will run through the basics of Twig as a templating system and show the advanced opportunities for Wordpress developers that Timber offers.\n\nJon is a 'Developer Evangelist' at Base, splitting his time between front-end dev and running digital events in the Dorset area.",

We'll start off with a breakneck primer on unit testing with PHPUnit and basic TDD concepts. Then we'll move on to getting set up with PhpSpec, followed by a guided tour of its main features.

Frameworks and CMSes created in PHP are popular enough to have self-sufficient communities, but this can often result in a lack of crossover between the communities. The result of the fragmentation is wasted effort and time as a developer but also a lack of knowledge transfer that extends outsides our own subgroup bubble.</p><p>This talk will bring some practical suggestions and solutions on how to look outside our comfort zones, widen our technical circles, and ensure that we learn from other peoples mistakes and bridge the gap between communities. As a result, we will make all our communities more diverse and stronger..</p>",
